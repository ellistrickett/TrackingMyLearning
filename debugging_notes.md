# The Debugging Mantra
## Tighten the loop and get visibility

1. Read the error message and understand what type of error it is 
   - If you have not seen the type of error before research this using resources or google.
2. Locate which line of the code the error is coming from using the error message
3. If it is not something obvious like a typo or things aren't in the right order etc - use 'puts' to gain visibility and help to understand each value of suspected variables.
4. Donâ€™t assume an obvious error is the cause -> a typo might be a typo throughout the program and not be causing any problems. Don't change something in one place until you have narrowed down and know this is the error
