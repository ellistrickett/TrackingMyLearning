# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

It is used as a mechanism to restrict direct access to objects’ data and methods. But the same time it facilitates operation on that data (objects’ methods).

Encapsulation tells us that we should know just an interface of class to be able to use it. We don't have to know anything about internals of class to be able to use it.
